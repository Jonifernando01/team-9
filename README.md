## 🎯 User Stories & Planning

### Epic 1: Task Management
- ✅ As a user, I can create a task with title, description, priority, and status
- ✅ As a user, I can view all my tasks sorted by priority
- ✅ As a user, I can update task details and status
- ✅ As a user, I can delete tasks I no longer need

### Epic 2: Organization & Filtering
- ✅ As a user, I can filter tasks by status (To-do, In Progress, Done)
- ✅ As a user, I can see task counts for each status
- ✅ As a user, I can see visual indicators for task priority

### Epic 3: Analytics & Insights
- ✅ As a user, I can see statistics about my task progress
- ✅ As a user, I can track completion rates
- ✅ As a user, I can see priority distribution
